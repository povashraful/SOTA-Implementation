# 📘 Transformers -Attention is all you need - Architecture Implementation
In this directory- there will be two types of code:
1- My own practice code of the transformers
2- More clear version of the transformers

In addition, I will me sharing my notes as well. 

Have a nice day

Implementation video: (coming soon)

I mainly followed a YouTube video title Coding transformers from scratch by Ali Hassan. I have provided the channel link above. I have also uploaded my notes (OneNote- Notebook) that I took while learning how to implement the architecture - feel free to go through it
